Text based adventure game

This is my first ever game! I am really happy that I made it and I taught myself a lot along the way! It is a text based adventure game where you fight monsters and stuff, it is only like 350 lines so I didn't make it so complicated but I am proud of myself anyways! If you stumble across this page please feel free to play it I would really appreciate it, thank you! >.>
